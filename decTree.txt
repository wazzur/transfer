implemented handling missing data via removing instances with those

implemented own tree via nested dictionaries

ran on playTennis during development

data:
breast cancer classification - recurrance vs no recurraces.
congressionaul house votes - classifies political party

breast cancer (286 instances, 9 features)
congressional (16 features, 435 instances)

breast cancer accuracy : 98.3/73.9 (9 removed, 275 remaining)
congressional accuracy : 92.2/93.5 (203 removed, 232 remaining)

tested recursively using list of choices for instances




Alisa Hawthorne()

Census Income dataset (Adult-data) (15 col, 48k instances)
Internet advertisements (classified ads based on pixel values) 
   * (1.6k cols, 3.2k instances)


used missing values as a classifier/value

handled continuous values by splitting in middle.
splits until pure buckets.

used array structure to simulate tree parsing, with each index determining an attribute.
test cases parse full tree to find pure buckets. (no children concept?)


census income accuracy: 75.91/76.37
Internet advertisement accuracy: 96.53/89.2
